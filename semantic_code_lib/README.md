# Semantic Code Library

This folder contains many Parrot semantic functions implementations for users to import. The organization of the lib is as follows:

- `app/`: Contains semantic functions for LLM-Agent based applications. These applications are demos to show the Frontend of Parrot.
- `bench`: Contains semantic functions for benchmarking. Functions in this folder are often meaningless and have fixed-length outputs for reproducibility.
- `codegen`: Contains some code generator for semantic functions.
- 
Some of the functions are handmade by our team. The others are referenced from different prompt sharing platfroms. For the latter, we will mark the source of the functions in the beginning of the function definition.
